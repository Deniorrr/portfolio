            <h3>How I started</h3>
            <p>
              I began my story with programming when I was just 12 years old. My teacher told me about HTML. I created a website about a game series using only HTML.
              Two years later I've been told about Scratch. It's a visual programming language and enviroment to create simple games in 2D connecting logical blocks.
              I created a few bigger projects using it. In high school I learned proper HTML and CSS. A few months later I was showed the basics of PHP and JS.

            <h3>What I enjoy making</h3>
            <p>I enjoy creating projects, that require inventing logical algorythms, which I can implement in basic languages like javascript without any libraries. That's
              how i came up with sudoku solver, snake game or rubiks cube timer. However I also like to learn new libraries and frameworks. I learned bootstrap, which I use
              when I don't have to focus on frontend. I also enjoy creating simple games alone, or some bigger ones in a group.
